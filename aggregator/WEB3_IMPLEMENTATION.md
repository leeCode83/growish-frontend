# Web3 Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated @xellar/kit, wagmi, and viem for Web3 functionality in the Growish DeFi Aggregator application with batch deposit system.

## Contract Initialization

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before users can deposit or withdraw, the Router contract must be initialized with vault addresses. This is a **one-time setup** that must be performed by the contract owner.

### Initialize Router (Contract Owner Only)

```bash
cd aggregator
npx tsx scripts/initialize-router.ts
```

See [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md) for detailed initialization instructions.

### Verify Initialization

Check the "Router Contract Status" card on the dashboard to verify all vaults are registered. The status should show:
- ✅ Conservative Vault (RiskLevel 0) - Initialized
- ✅ Balanced Vault (RiskLevel 1) - Initialized  
- ✅ Aggressive Vault (RiskLevel 2) - Initialized

If not initialized, all deposit/withdraw transactions will revert.

## Contract Architecture

### Smart Contract Addresses (Lisk Sepolia Testnet)

**Core Contracts:**
- Router Contract: `0x7dC0da00F845A4272C08E51a57651ac004f5e0C7`
- MockUSDC: `0x6f576F9A89555b028ce97581DA6d10e35d433F04`

**Vault Contracts:**
- Conservative Vault: `0x6E69Ed7A9b7F4b1De965328738b3d7Bb757Ea94c` (RiskLevel 0)
- Balanced Vault: `0x21AF332B10481972B903cBd6C3f1ec51546552e7` (RiskLevel 1)
- Aggressive Vault: `0xc4E50772bd6d27661EE12d81e62Daa4882F4E6f4` (RiskLevel 2)

**Strategy Contracts (Abstracted by Vaults):**
- Aave Strategy: `0x85A1B6A61C5E73418A40A3a79F6E811Ee848dAa7`
- Compound Strategy: `0x4B29149492019fE65D0363097728Cab61Cb97F0f`

**Mock Protocol Contracts:**
- MockProtocol Aave: `0x53175d08E96a961233ea333385EA74E74C556Cf1`
- MockProtocol Compound: `0x831f464C241eAa6CcF72F5570c7F5E5f9759317e`

**Important:** All addresses are checksummed using viem's `getAddress()` to ensure EIP-55 compliance.

### Batch Deposit System Architecture

The Router contract implements a **batch deposit/withdraw system** to optimize gas costs:

1. **Queue Phase**: Users deposit/withdraw, transactions are queued
2. **Batch Execution**: Periodically (every 6 hours), all queued transactions execute in one batch
3. **Claim Phase**: Users claim their vault shares (deposits) or USDC (withdrawals)

**RiskLevel Enum Mapping:**
- `0` = Conservative Vault (80% Aave, 20% Compound)
- `1` = Balanced Vault (50% Aave, 50% Compound)
- `2` = Aggressive Vault (30% Aave, 70% Compound)

## What Has Been Implemented

### 3. Custom Hooks (`/hooks/useContracts.ts`)

**New Batch System Hooks:**
- `usePendingDeposit(user, vaultType)` - Get user's queued deposit amount

## Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.90.11",
  "@xellar/kit": "^2.4.3",
  "viem": "~2.40.3",
  "wagmi": "^3.0.2",
  "@walletconnect/ethereum-provider": "2.23.0"

## Key Features

### Batch Deposit System
The application implements a gas-optimized batch deposit/withdraw system:

**Deposit Workflow:**
1. User calls `deposit(amount, riskLevel)` on Router contract
2. Deposit is queued and added to pending deposits
3. User receives `DepositQueued` event
4. Every 6 hours, batch execution happens (automated keeper)
5. All pending deposits are processed together
6. User receives vault shares proportional to deposit
7. User calls `claimDepositShares(riskLevel)` to receive vault tokens
8. User receives `DepositClaimed` event

**Withdrawal Workflow:**
1. User calls `withdraw(shares, riskLevel)` on Router contract
2. Withdrawal is queued and added to pending withdrawals
3. User receives `WithdrawQueued` event
4. Every 6 hours, batch execution happens (automated keeper)
5. All pending withdrawals are processed together
6. Vault shares are converted to USDC
7. User calls `claimWithdrawAssets(riskLevel)` to receive USDC
8. User receives `WithdrawClaimed` event

**Benefits:**
- Gas costs shared among all users in batch
- Significantly cheaper than individual transactions
- Automated execution every 6 hours
- Users can cancel pending deposits/withdrawals before batch execution

### Smart Contract Interaction
- Read contract data (pending deposits, claimable shares, batch timing)
- Write operations (deposit, withdraw, claim)
- Token approvals
- Event listening
- Batch status monitoring

### User Experience
- Automatic balance updates every 30 seconds
- Pending deposit/withdrawal tracking
- Claimable amount display
- Next batch time countdown
- Transaction confirmation tracking
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states during transactions
- Success notifications with explorer links

### Testing Support
- Test token faucet for easy testing
- Mint 1,000 USDC with one click
- All on Lisk Sepolia testnet

### Network Safety
- Network status indicator
- Warnings when on wrong network
- Only works on Lisk Sepolia (Chain ID: 4202)

## Build Issue Resolution

The application uses Next.js 16 with Turbopack by default. To build successfully:

```bash
# Option 1: Use webpack explicitly (recommended for now)
pnpm build -- --webpack

# Option 2: Use turbopack explicitly
pnpm build -- --turbopack
```

The `next.config.mjs` has been configured with both webpack and turbopack support.

Create `.env.local` if you want to customize:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

Default WalletConnect Project ID is already configured for testing.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors with Turbopack:
1. Use `pnpm build -- --webpack` instead
2. Or wait for Turbopack to fully support all dependencies

### Wallet Not Connecting
1. Ensure you have a Web3 wallet installed (MetaMask recommended)
2. Switch to Lisk Sepolia network manually
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Transactions Failing
1. Check you're on Lisk Sepolia (Chain ID: 4202)
2. Ensure you have test ETH for gas fees
3. Check token approval before depositing
4. Verify contract addresses are correct

### Test Tokens Not Appearing
1. Wait for transaction confirmation
2. Check transaction on block explorer
3. Refresh the page
4. Check you're viewing the correct network

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Deploy actual Router and vault contracts to Lisk Sepolia
2. **Update Contract Addresses**: Replace mock addresses with real contract addresses in `/lib/contracts.ts`
3. **Add More Assets**: Expand supported assets beyond USDC/USDT
4. **Implement Real APY**: Calculate actual APY from vault performance
5. **Add Transaction History**: Track and display user's transaction history
6. **Implement Notifications**: Add toast notifications for better UX
7. **Add Portfolio Charts**: Integrate real portfolio value charts
8. **Security Audit**: Audit smart contracts before mainnet deployment
